      <description>While learning Flexbox somthing I had quite some problem trying to figure out how to center an element on a page with CSS and Flexbox, its not that difficult but sometimes you just don&amp;rsquo;t see the easy solution when its right in fromt of you.
#element{ display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;  I hope this can help some of you. Enjoy!</description>
